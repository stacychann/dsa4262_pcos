# ðŸ§  Machine Learning for PCOS Prediction and Analysis

This project explores the application of machine learning (ML) techniques to predict Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) using clinical and lifestyle data. PCOS is a common hormonal disorder among women of reproductive age, with symptoms ranging from irregular menstrual cycles to long-term health risks such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease.

Our project investigates traditional ML models as well as deep learning architectures â€” including a novel TabTransformer-based model â€” to enhance diagnostic accuracy.
